I came from a third world country growing up under extreme under-resourced circumstances with very limited educational opportunities. Back in Guinea, I was fascinated with math, physics and technology. My love for physics made me create a strong bond with nature and an unexplainable love for spoken words. I then started writing poetry during my freshman year. Since then, my interest opened to a wider area within literature. I worked on some short stories that I collected in a novel book. In addition, I began a novel which is my biggest project as a writer. 
As of today, I am both involved in programming and writing. I consider writing skills as deep practice to become more creative as a programmer because it gives me the ability to think within and outside the box simultaneously.
I came to the United States in February 2016 and immediately started hunting opportunities to put me on the right path to pursue my dreams. 
I came across ScriptEd, which is an opportunity for me to learn to code. Surprisingly, it became more than that. ScriptEd has sent me to companies that I could not imagine stepping into such as Google for hackathons and Salesforce for mentorship.
