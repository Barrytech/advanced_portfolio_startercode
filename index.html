                    Software rewrote my software itself? Technology has taken my life from me and it claims to make it better. What is a better life anyway? If I have forgotten what it was like to sit around like an old man listening to stories similar to “Samba et compere
                    Lapin.” If I have forgotten early morning birds’ chirping that usually wake me up while the sun’s rays scratches the nocturne morn of my grassy roadway. Lord! I want my modest routine back, please do not let it fade anymore! It is
                    even very sad this so called modern life. I have stopped being part of the nature to end up chasing that nature. Making my life better, I have killed my emotional ties to that nature because I have a savage new nature. I damaged the
                    chilly clouds for the birds because I think their homes aren’t theirs. And now, I have trapped myself to loneliness and thinking about aliens who weren’t here back then. It is an advancement which has split families apart due addiction
                    to smartphones. Teenagers like me, no longer rely on surroundings since one sample click is able to put them within a different continent. Now I am worried because it has been classified as an health issue. While many are referring
                    to it as addiction which made me use the term, I prefer to accuse it of being those softwares rewriting my software. I see this dependence rising and yet, those devices have become a necessary evil. Sometimes I want to wake up and
                    not have to look at snapchat stories or instagram pictures, but feed some birds or contemplate that flock of sparrow. This addiction changes my brain and the last thing I need is to be less smarter. Being honest to myself, I know I
                    have already become. Spending an hour without intelligence assistance has become a challenge to almost everyone. For those who have smartphones, laptops or smart watches, notifications have become more important than reflexion. What
                    is that one thing I do and without including any tech and remember how good mother nature is? I am consumed by softwares. But am I even aware? Remember, this phone is a device which is working under electricity. So the electrical circuit
                    inside smartphones generates an electromagnetic field that can be harmful to our body. Troubling statistics reveal endangered Australians because of exposure to computing tomography scans in childhood. Personally, I made this remark
                    on this subject. When we use our phone while it is on charge, after a moment we feel that our hand begins shattering. I think that is the crossing electrons through the body which is conductive of electrical current. This physical
                    phenomenon has a dangerous consequences on our health even lead to paralysis. And even something as bad to be cancer. But, today if we try to stand without the smart devices I don’t know how our life will be. It is not fair that it
                    has almost become impossible. The worst part is that mostly the whole world will be paralyzed. In the same way, the evolution will stop and the humanity will be forced to go back to his humanly and physically eagerness to see his labor.
                    Isn’t what I want? But wait, do I want it to be downgraded that far? Certainly not. I would be looking like an idiot legend from the future imposting in the 1800s like in the tv show Legends of tomorrow.
