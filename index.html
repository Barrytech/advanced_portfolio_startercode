I came from a third world country growing up under extreme underressourmcent with very limited educational opportunities. Back in Guinea, I was fascinated with math, physics and technologies. My love for physics made me create a strong bond with nature and an unexplainable love for spoken words. I then started writing poetry on my freshman year. Since then, my interest opened to a wider area within the literator. I worked on some short stories that I collect on a novel book in addition to a romance which is my biggest project as a writer. 
As of today, I am technically more involved in programming than I write literator. However, I consider those skills as deep practice to become more creative as a programmer because it gave the ability to think within and outside the box simultaneously.
I came to the United States in February 2016 and directly started hunting opportunities to put me on the right path to pursue my dreams. 
I come across ScriptEd, which is an opportunity for me to learn to code. Surprisingly to me, it became more than that. ScriptEd has sent me to companies that I could not imagine stepping in to  such as Google for hackathons and Salesforce for mentorship.
